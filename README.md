Random scripts for mystery hunting

Ideas:
 - Caesar shifting
 - Other ciphers?
 - Anagram finder
 - Frequency analysis
 - Sudoku solver? (Any good way of generalizing?)
 - BFS/DFS brute force abstractions
 - Fill in words (http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2013/coinheist.com/indiana/dropped_quotes/index.html)
 - Statistical analysis (random vs not random)
 - Others? (http://www.winterdragon.org/index.php?page=puzzle-sites)

Notes:
 - words.txt taken from /usr/share/dict/words, approx 200,000+, case sensitive
 - dictionary.txt taken from http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~foster/dictionary.txt, approx 350,000+, case insensitive, includes things like "aaagghhhh"
